# Facebook UI Clone

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 100%;">
    <img src="screenshots/fb clone/fb_clone_s1.png" width="48%"></img>
    <img src="screenshots/fb clone/fb_clone_s2.png" width="48%"></img>
</div>

Note: This is only a basic version of the UI, a responsive design will be added later.
